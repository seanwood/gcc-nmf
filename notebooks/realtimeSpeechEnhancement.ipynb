    "### Dependencies\n",
    "In addition to [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) and [scipy](https://www.scipy.org/), a few additional dependencies are required:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [Theano](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/) for its GPU acceleration and optimizing compiler.\n",
    "2. [PyAudio](https://people.csail.mit.edu/hubert/pyaudio/) for real-time audio playback.\n",
    "\n",
    "To run the graphical user interface, we also require:\n",
    "1. [PyQt](https://riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/intro) Python bindings for the [Qt](https://www.qt.io/) application framework.\n",
    "2. [pyqtgraph](http://www.pyqtgraph.org/) scientific graphics and GUI library.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installing dependencies\n",
    "All dependencies can be installed with [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/), either on the command line:\n",
    "\n",
    "`$ pip install numpy scipy theano pyaudio`\n",
    "\n",
    "`$ pip install pyqt5 pyqtgraph`\n",
